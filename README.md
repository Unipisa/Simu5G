PDCP-RRC

- Header compression/decompression
- Logical connection establishment and maintenance
- E-UTRA/NR Dual connectivity
- Split Bearer 

RLC

- Multiplexing/Demultiplexing of MAC SDUs
- UM, (AM and TM testing) modes

MAC

- HARQ functionalities
- Allocation management
- AMC
- Scheduling Policies (MAX C/I, Proportional Fair, DRR)
- Carrier Aggregation
- Support to multiple numerologies
- Flexible TDD/FDD

PHY

- Channel Feedback management
- Realistic 3GPP channel model with
  - inter-cell interference
  - path-loss
  - fast fading
  - shadowing 
  - (an)isotropic antennas

Advanced features

- X2 communication support
- X2-based handover
- CoMP Coordinated Scheduling support
- Device-to-device communications
- Support for vehicular mobility (integration with Veins 5.2)
- ETSI-compliant model of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) systems


Applications

- Voice-over-IP (VoIP)
- Constant Bit Rate (CBR)
- Trace-based Video-on-demand (VoD)


Real-time emulation support
---------------------------

Simu5G supports real-time network emulation capabilities. Navigate to
one of the examples included in the "emulation" folder and take a look
at the README file included therein.


Limitations
-----------

- User Plane only (Control Plane not modeled)
- no EPS bearer support – note: a similar concept, "connections", has 
  been implemented, but they are neither dynamic nor statically 
  configurable via some config file
- radio bearers not implemented, not even statically configured radio 
  bearers (dynamically allocating bearers would need the RRC protocol, 
  which is Control Plane so not implemented)
