ExtClientServer Emulation example
---------------------------------

In this example the network consists of one UE connected to one gNB, one UPF, 
one NAT router, one router, one external (real) server and one external (real) client.

The external client application (i.e. associated to the UE in the emulation) sends 10MB 
using TCP to the external server application, traversing the emulated 5G network.

Packets sent needs to be smaller than the MTU of the veth interface (1500 byte by default)

IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files (see "routing" folder).
 
*** NOTE ***
In order to run an emulation where both the endpoints of a connection are real applications,
the client application (i.e. associated to the UE) must use the IP address of the NAT router 
within the emulation as destination address. Such NAT router will perform Network Address 
Translation (NAT), according to the rules specified with the corresponding parameter in the 
INI file. 
For example, if the client IP address is 192.168.3.2, while the server
IP address is 192.168.2.2, the NAT rules on the simulated NAT router are set as:
   
    *.router.ipv4.natTable.config = xml("<config> \
                                            <entry type='prerouting' \
                                            packetDataFilter='*Ipv4Header and destAddress=~10.0.2.1' \
                                            srcAddress='192.168.2.1' destAddress='192.168.2.2'/> \
                                            <entry type='prerouting' \
                                            packetDataFilter='*Ipv4Header and destAddress=~192.168.2.1' \
                                            srcAddress='10.0.2.1' destAddress='192.168.3.2'/> \
                                         </config>")
 
 
How to build and run the emulation 
----------------------------------

1) Make sure that the emulation feature is enabled in the INET project:

- via the IDE: right-click on the 'inet' folder in the Project Explorer -> Properties;
               select OMNeT++ -> Project Features; 
               tick the box "Network emulation support".
- via the command line: in the root INET folder, type 'opp_featuretool enable NetworkEmulationSupport'.

  Recompile INET with the command 'make makefiles && make' (in the root INET folder).  


2) In order to be able to send/receive packets through sockets, set the application permissions (specify
   the path of your OMNeT installation): 

    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_dbg
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_release


3) Compile Simu5G from the command line by running (in the root Simu5G folder):
    
    $ . setenv
	$ make makefiles
	$ make MODE=release 
	 	
	 	
4) Run the external server, e.g. use "Iperf" with the following command:
  	    
  	iperf -s -P 1 -i 1 -p 10021

5) Run the emulation by launching either
     
    ./run_wSocket.sh 
    
        or 
    
    ./run_wTun.sh 

6) Run the external client, e.g. use "Iperf" with the following command:
  	    
  	iperf -c 10.0.2.1 -P 1 -i 1 -m -p 10021 -M 536.0B -l 10.0M -f m -t 0
