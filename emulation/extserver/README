ExtServer Emulation example
---------------------------

In this example the network consists of two UEs connected to one gNB, one UPF, 
one router and one external (real) server.

The external server sends 10MB to ue1 using TCP (in the downlink), whereas 
ue2 sends 10MB to the external server using TCP (in the uplink).

IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files (see "routing" folder).
 
 
How to build and run the emulation 
----------------------------------

1) Make sure that the emulation feature is enabled in the INET project:

- via the IDE: right-click on the 'inet' folder in the Project Explorer -> Properties;
               select OMNeT++ -> Project Features; 
               tick the box "Network emulation support".
- via the command line: in the root INET folder, type 'opp_featuretool enable NetworkEmulationSupport'.

  Recompile INET with the command 'make makefiles && make' (in the root INET folder).  


2) In order to be able to send/receive packets through sockets, set the application permissions (specify
   the path of your OMNeT installation): 

    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_dbg
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip path/to/opp_run_release


3) Compile Simu5G from the command line by running (in the root Simu5G folder):
    
    $ . setenv
	$ make makefiles
	$ make MODE=release 
	 	
4) Run the external server for the uplink traffic, e.g. use "Iperf" with the following command (type
   "man iperf" for options description):
  	    
  	iperf -s -P 1 -i 1 -p 10021

5) Run the emulation by launching either
     
    ./run_wSocket.sh 
    
        or 
    
    ./run_wTun.sh 

6) Run the external server for the downlink traffic, e.g. use "Iperf" with the following command(type
   "man iperf" for options description):
  	    
  	iperf -c 10.0.0.1 -P 1 -i 1 -m -p 10021 -M 536.0B -l 10.0M -f m -t 0
