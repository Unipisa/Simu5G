/**
 * Objective of the Traffic Flow Filter is mapping IP 4-Tuples to TFT identifiers. This commonly means identifying a bearer and
 * associating it to an ID that will be recognized by the first GTP-U entity
 *
 * This simplified traffic filter queries the Binder to find the destination of the packet.
 * It resides at both the eNodeB and the PGW. At the PGW, when a packet comes to the traffic flow filter, the latter finds the
 * destination endpoint (the eNodeB serving the destination UE) of the GTP tunnel that needs to be established. At the eNodeB,
 * the destination endpoint is always the PGW. However, if the fastForwarding flag is enabled and the destination of the packet
 * is within the same cell, the packet is just relayed to the Radio interface.
