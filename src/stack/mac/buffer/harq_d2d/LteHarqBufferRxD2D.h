 * checking its correctness.
 * A feedback is sent after the PDU has been evaluated (HARQ_FB_EVALUATION_INTERVAL), and
 * in case of ACK the PDU moves to CORRECT state, else it is dropped from the process.
 * The operations of checking if a PDU is ready for feedback and if it is in correct state are
 * done in the extractCorrectPdu method which must be called at every TTI (it must be part
 * of the MAC main loop).
