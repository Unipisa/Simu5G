//
// This module extends LTE PHY functionalities at the User Equipment side to support device-to-device (D2D)
// communications. Specifically, it customizes the ~LtePhyUe functionalities to support the transmission and reception
// of frames to another UE directly, without going through the serving eNodeB. It also supports one-to-many
// D2D transmission to UEs belonging to a multicast group. It is assumed that one-to-one D2D communication is only possible
// when both endpoints are served by the same eNodeB. When a handover is triggered, this module is responsible
// for initiating a mode switch from direct (D2D) mode to infrastructure mode.
