/*
 * This module is responsible for keep trace of all PDCP SDUs.
 * A PDCP SDU passes the following state while it is going down
 * through the LTE NIC layers:
 * 
 * PDCP SDU
 * few operations
 * PDCP PDU
 * RLC SDU
 * RLC PDU or fragmented in more then one RLC PDUs
 * MAC SDU
 * inserted into one TB
 * MAC PDU (aka TB)
 *
 * Each PDCP has its own seq number, managed by the corresponding LCID
 * 
 * The main functions of this module are:
 *  - detect PDCP SDU discarded (no part transmitted)
 *  - calculate the delay time of a pkt, from PDCP SDU to last Harq ACK of the
 *    corresponding seq number.
