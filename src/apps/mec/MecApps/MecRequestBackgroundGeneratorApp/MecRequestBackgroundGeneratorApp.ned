// This module implements a generator of requests to be sent to the ~LocationService.
// This application can be instantiated as an "independent MEC app" (see ~MecHost
// module), meaning it does not need to be instantiated via the MEC orchestrator upon
// request from a User Equipment. Specifically, this module produces batches of
// GET requests, as generated by a configurable number of MEC applications
// running on the MEC host. The effect of such requests is to delay the service
// of actual requests (i.e., those originating from complete MEC applications)
